// foreground application — so the child got its own Dock tile, showing the

// the packaged binary with ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE and nothing else: no tile
// until `process.title` is assigned, then a second tile appears.

// Making the property a no-op keeps the Dock to one tile. Nothing depends on

// PGlite data directory open. PGlite has no real cross-process lock, so an
// orphan left running this way silently corrupts the next launch's database
// instead of merely failing to start. Polling ppid and exiting the moment
// it becomes 1 bounds how long an orphan can live to one tick of this timer.

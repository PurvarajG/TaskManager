 * Regression test for the data-loss defect: Today renders as soon as
 * useNow() resolves, which is before tracking settings has loaded. The
 * collapse toggle must not fire patchSettings while `settings` is still
 * null — patchSettings replaces the WHOLE collapsedModules array
 * (lib/store/tracking-settings.ts), so a click that lands before settings
 * arrives would persist a single-entry array and destroy every other
 * collapsed module (including Tracking's backfilled default).
